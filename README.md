Hi! I'm Tomas Generoso, I like programming and design. I stand out for the predisposition to do whatever comes my way and the perseverance to reach the goal.

I am Fullstack Web Developer Jr. (MERN Stack) and CEO in a appmobile.

I studied up to 3rd year of Systems Engineering (National Technological University) and I take courses and read with great pleasure, day by day, articles to educate myself on the world of coding.

I really like English. I've traveled for almost 6 months in the USA, where I significantly improved my English.

My dream is to reach the top of programming and that is why I study and practice every day with great enthusiasm. That is why I am willing to give all my desire and knowledge to do my best wherever I play.
