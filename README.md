Hello! I'm TomÃ¡s Generoso. I stand out for the predisposition to do what comes my way and the perseverance to reach the goal.
I'm a Fullstack Web Developer. 
Current technologies: React, Next.js, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Express, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Blender3D, Cordova, YAML, Adobe Creative Cloud (AdobeXD, Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.), Figma, Jira, PHP, Java (basic), Python (basic), C# (basic), among others.

I speak English (C1), Italian (fluid), Spanish (Native), German (A1)

I studied until 3rd year of Systems Engineering (National Technological University).
Currently I teach myself with great pleasure, day by day, in a self-taught way, through courses and documentation.
My dream is to reach the top of programming and that is why I study and practice every day with great enthusiasm.

As for my experience, I have had the opportunity to work as a fullstack node.js developer for a company in Chile. As a systems analyst or functional analyst at the largest sports club in my city, I also had experiences with my ventures as a UX/UI designer, product owner, and others. I also have experience as a Trainee in a retail company, where I was in charge of hardware and software installation.
