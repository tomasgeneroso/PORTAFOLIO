Hello! I'm Tom√°s Generoso, I like programming and design. I stand out for the predisposition to do what comes my way and the perseverance to reach the goal.
I'm a Fullstack Web Developer Jr. (MERN Stack), UX/UI Designer Jr and CEO of a mobile app.

I studied until 3rd year of Systems Engineering (National Technological University).
Currently I teach myself with great pleasure, day by day, in a self-taught way, through courses and documentation.

I really like English. I have traveled for almost 6 months in the US, where I significantly improved my English.

My dream is to reach the top of programming and that is why I study and practice every day with great enthusiasm.

I have the papers ready to process my Italian citizenship.
